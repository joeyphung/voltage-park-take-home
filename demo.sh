# A script to run the full video generation service and test it.
#
# Prerequisites:
#   - Docker is installed and the Docker Desktop application is running.
#   - A Python virtual environment named 'venv' exists with all requirements installed.
#   - 'jq' is installed for parsing JSON (e.g., 'sudo apt-get install jq' on Linux
#     or 'brew install jq' on macOS, or 'winget install jqlang.jq' on Windows).
#
# Usage:
#   Make the script executable: chmod +x run_demo.sh
#   Run it with the path to your image: ./run_demo.sh /path/to/your/image.png

# This ensures all other paths are correct, regardless of where the script is called from.
